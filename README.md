# gram_grep
Search text using a grammer, lexer, or straight regex. Chain searches for greater refinement.

This tool uses lexertl14, parsertl14 and wildcardtl so be sure to download those too from my github page.

See https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1197135/gram-grep-grep-for-the-st-century for examples.
