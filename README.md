# gram_grep
Search text using a grammer, lexer, or straight regex. Chain searches for greater refinement.

This tool uses lexertl14, parsertl14 and wildcardtl so be sure to download those too from my github page.

To build with g++: g++ -o gram_grep main.cpp -I ../lexertl14/include -I ../parsertl14/include -I ../wildcardtl/include -O3
